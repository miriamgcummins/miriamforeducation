    <h1>Miriam G. Cummins</h1>
    <h2>A Passion for Education</h2>
    <div class="about__image-wrap"><img class="image" src="/miriamforeducation/assets/miriam.png" alt="Miriam G. Cummins Headshot"></div> 
    <p>Miriam Cummins, a mother of a Daughter in public school, and a Son who receives special education services from LBL ESD, is a proud advocate for Latino families and equitable education. As an immigrant herself, Miriam understands the needs for minority representation, and cultural inclusiveness in schools.</p>

    <p>Miriam believes that there is a lack of understanding and accountability in the school system and has always worked to allow families to get what they deserve. This passion for advocacy has driven Miriam her whole life, and now drives her to seeking the positions of both the Greater Albany Public School Board and the Linn Benton Lincoln ESD Board.</p>

    <p>Miriam was born in Zamora, Michoacan, Mexcio. She immigrated to the United States in 1996 where she first learned English at elementary school in Coos Bay, Oregon. While working to help her father start his own business as a General Contractor, Miriam graduated from Marshfield High School with Honors.</p>

    <p>Miriam was awarded a scholarship through the Ford Family Foundation as a Ford Scholar and attended Western Oregon University. Before transferring to Oregon State University, Miriam studied abroad in Spain, then took another opportunity to study abroad in France after her first year at OSU.</p>

    <p>In 2009 Miriam married her college sweetheart Basil Cummins. In 2011 Miriam Graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and a Minor in French. After college Miriam worked in the Financial Aid Office at OSU where she thoroughly enjoyed helping students find opportunities to pay for their studies.</p>

    <p>Two years later after her Daughter was born, Miriam took a job in Albany as an Interpreter/Translator for Linn Benton Lincoln ESD. At this job Miriam interacted with wide range of families that were seeking help and didn’t know about the services available to them. After seeing a need for minority representation and the beginnings of her family growing (with the birth of her Son), Miriam obtained her US Citizenship in 2016.</p>

    <p>Because of her position at LBL, Miriam felt that she couldn’t fully advocate for the families she met. This eventually led Miriam to take her current position at Salem-Keizer Coalition for Equality as a Resource Development and Executive Assistant in 2018.</p>

    <p>Miriam’s experience in higher education as well as in K-12 public systems, and her knowledge in special education (both as an advocate and a parent), will make her a strong advocate for working families.  Miriam has always been open to listen to the needs of parents and is very compassionate and understanding. These are the skills that she will bring to the Boards and make her the right choice.</p>

    <p>As a parent your voice needs to be heard.  Please vote for Miriam to make sure your voice is heard.</p>
