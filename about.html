    <h1>Miriam G. Cummins</h1>
    <h2>A Passion for Education</h2>
    <div class="about__image-wrap"><img class="image" src="/assets/miriam.png" alt="Miriam G. Cummins Headshot"></div> 
    <p>Miriam Cummins, a mother of two children who attend public school, is a proud advocate for Albany parents and students, Latino families and underrepresented communities. As an immigrant herself, Miriam grew up believing and working towards the American Dream.  Now as a mother and wife, she is imparting those values to her children.  She also understands the value of hard work and starting from the bottom.</p>

    <p>Miriam was born in Zamora, Michoacan, Mexico. She immigrated to the United States in 1996 where she first learned English at elementary school in Coos Bay, Oregon. While working to help her father start his own business as a General Contractor, Miriam graduated from Marshfield High School with Honors.</p>

    <p>Miriam believes that House District 15 needs a strong leader that will advocate, represent and do their due diligence.  It is important that we hold accountability, and as a State Representative, the duty is to show up at legislation, whether you agree or disagree with the bill, to assure representation of District 15.</p>

    <p>Miriam was awarded a scholarship through the Ford Family Foundation as a Ford Scholar and attended Western Oregon University. Before transferring to Oregon State University, Miriam studied abroad in Spain, then took another opportunity to study abroad in France after her first year at OSU.</p>

    <p>In 2009 Miriam married her college sweetheart Basil Cummins. In 2011 Miriam Graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and a Minor in French. After college Miriam worked in the Financial Aid Office at OSU where she thoroughly enjoyed helping students find opportunities to pay for their studies.</p>

    <p>Two years later after her daughter was born, Miriam took a job in Albany as an Interpreter/Translator for Linn Benton Lincoln ESD. At this job, Miriam interacted with a wide range of families that were seeking help and didn’t know about the services available to them. After seeing a need for minority representation and the beginnings of her family growing (with the birth of her son), Miriam obtained her US Citizenship in 2016.</p>

    <p>Miriam currently serves on the Linn Benton Lincoln ESD Board of Directors.  She has gone to Washington DC, met with the US Representatives and advocated for Full Funding of IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act).  During that advocacy, she also brought up issues of stigmatization of mental health, and the importance of schools working alongside families in addressing mental health; especially in their native language.</p>

    <p>Because of her position at LBL, Miriam felt that she couldn’t fully advocate for the families she met. This eventually led Miriam to take her current position at Salem-Keizer Coalition for Equality as a Resource Development and Executive Assistant in 2018.</p>

    <p>Miriam’s experience in higher education as well as in K-12 public systems, as well as her advocacy skills, will make her a strong leader for working families. Miriam has always been open to listening to people's needs and is very compassionate and understanding. These are the skills that she will bring as a State Representative.  She doesn't want there to be barriers that come between the Capitol and the people.  She wants to hear from you.  She wants to know what you think and how she can address these issues.  She is here for you!  She will get things done!</p>

    <p>As a neighbor, friend and community member of District 15,  your voice needs to be heard. Please vote for Miriam, and you will see that things will get done!</p>
