            Having the option for parents and the Board to come up with a compromise in which families can have the least impact with their families; requesting transfer and assuring the class size for each grade level is appropriate for learning.

        <p class="feature-box__text">
          Miriam believes that there should be classes that emphasize the everyday real-world situations we all face. For example: how to do your taxes, how to balance a home budget, about rent/mortgages, etc.  All of these are things missing from public education and are causing a huge gap in the capabilities of students to make themselves independent upon graduation.
